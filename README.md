# Basic Render Pipeline

---

Basic rendering pipeline written in C++ and openGL (for GPU/hardware portions) for Purdue CS535 course project.

Includes support for the following:

* Wireframe rendering
* Filled rendering
* Projective texture mapping
* Tiling texture mapping
* Shadow mapping
* Ray tracing (computationally intense)
* Environment mapping
* Environment mapped specular reflections
